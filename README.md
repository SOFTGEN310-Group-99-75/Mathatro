# Mathatro
Mathatro aims to provide an educational while entertaining way for students to learn math. Through interaction with numbers and operators, students will be more familiar with the math concepts.

## About the project

The game uses a deck of playing cards with numbers and operators. To progress, the player must combine these cards to meet the objective of each level — for example, “>17” or “<9”. The aim is to beat all 10 levels and achieve the highest score possible.

There are multiple difficulty tiers - Easy, Medium or Hard. Each offers unique increases in both difficulty and fun. Difficuly can affect the range of possible objective solution numbers, the types of mathematical operators provided on cards, and the number of rounds per game.

Whether you’re a math whiz or someone who finds math challenging, you’re bound to have some fun!!!
